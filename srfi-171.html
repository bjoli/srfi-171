<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>A library implementing transducers &mdash; composable algorithmic
  transformations.  Scheme has many different ways of expressing
  transformations over different collection types, but they are all
  unique to whatever base type they work on.  This srfi proposes a new
  construct, the transducer, that is oblivious to the context of which
  it is being used</p>

<h1 id="issues">Issues</h1> <h2 id="state">State</h2>

<p>We have the issue of state to handle.  Hidden state is ugly, but at
  the same time passing state with the transduction means quite a lot
  of extra housekeeping.  The simplest solution would be to pass the
  current result wrapped with a list of states, i.e: (cons result
  state) where each transducer that is keeping state is responsible
  for moving it forward.  It would not matter in the context of
  user-facing functions such as transduce, but would be somewhat of a
  burden when used as a regular step in other transformations.</p>

<p>That simple solution would mean removing tail-call elimination for
  state-keeping transducers, but that might be a cost worth
  having.  Any suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>I also don't know how that would play with some compiler
  optimizations.  Chez seems to be able to efficiently inline a lot,
  completely removing a lot of the work (i.e. <code>(transduce (tmap …) …)</code>
  is almost as fast as <code>(map …)</code>)</p>

<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>

<p>Another question is whether transducers like tcat and tdedupe
  should be different from procedures that return transducers (like
  tmap).  As it is now, you have to run (tdedupe), which really isn't
  necessary.</p> <h2 id="what-to-export">What to export</h2>

<p>In the sample implementation, collection-transduce dispatches to a
  reducing function.  They are used in parts of the sample
  implementation (tflatten and tcat), and they aren't a must-have
  since the usages in the sample implementation could be rewritten to
  use transduce.  There might be cases where one just wants to use the
  reducer you have, and if you want to use it with transduce you would
  then need a &quot;null-transducer&quot; that does nothing.</p>

<p>I want to export these procedures, but then the naming needs to
  change.  Suddenly having list/vector/string/bytevector-reduce is
  weird.  Should they be exported and what should they be called? They
  behave like reduce from SRFI 1, apart from checking for reduced
  values, but it still doesn't feel right.</p>

<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>

<p>Some of the most common operations used in the scheme language are
  those transforming list: map, filter, take and so on.  They work
  well, are well understood and are used daily by most scheme
  programmers.  They are however not general because they only work on
  lists, and they do not compose very well since combining <code>N</code>
  of them builds <code>(- N 1)</code> intermediate lists.</p>

<p>Transducers are oblivious to what kind of process they are used in,
  and are composable without building intermediate collections.  This
  means we can create a transducer that squares all even numbers:
  <code>(compose (tfilter odd?) (tmap (lambda (x) (* x x))))</code>
  and reuse it with lists, vectors or in just about any context where
  data flows in one direction.  We could use it as a processing step
  for asynchronous channels, with an event framework as a
  pre-processing step or even in lazy contexts where you pass lazy
  collection and a transducer to a function and get a new lazy
  collection back.</p>

<p>The traditional scheme approach of having collection-specific
  procedures is not changed.  We instead specify a general form of
  transformations that complement these procedures.  The benefits are
  obvious: We get a clear, well understood way of describing common
  transformations in a way that is faster than just chaining the
  collection-specific counterparts.  Even for slower schemes where the
  overhead of transducers is big, the effects on garbage collection
  times are often dramatic, making transducers a very attractive.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>The sample implementation of transducers depends on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SRFI 9, <code>define-record-type</code></li>
  <li>A hash-table implementation</li>
  <li>Proper compose procedure (included if it is not available)</li>
  <li>A <code>vector-&gt;list</code> that behaves like in SRFI 43</li></ul>

<h2 id="portability">Portability</h2>

<p>The sample implementation is easily portable to any
r5rs/r6rs-compatible scheme.  The non-standard things are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <code>vector-&gt;list</code> that takes a start and end
    argument</li>
  <li>hash tables with support for <code>set</code>, <code>get</code>
    and discovering whether a key exists.</li>
  <li><code>case-lambda</code> (preferably efficiently
    implemented).</li></ul>

<h1 id="general-discussion">General discussion</h1>

<p>Even though transducers are somewhat of a generalisation of map and
  friends, this is not really true.  Since transducers don't know in
  which context they are being used, some transducers must keep state
  where their collection-specific counterparts do not.  This SRFI
  requires some transducers to be stateless (as is stated in the
  documentation of each transducer), but many are allowed to keep
  state.</p>

<p>The central part of transducers are 3-arity reducing functions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>()</code>: Produce an identity</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far</em><code>)</code>: completion.
    If you have nothing to do, then just return the result so far</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far input</em><code>)</code> do
    whatever you like to the input and produce a new
    <em>result-so-far</em></li></ul>

<p>In the case of a summing <code>+</code> reducer, the reducer would
  produce, in arity order: <code>0</code>, <em>result-so-far</em>,
  (<code>+</code> <em>result-so-far input</em>).  This happens to be
  exactly what the regular <code>+</code> does.</p>

<p>A transducer is a one-arity function that takes a reducing function
  (in the list below called simply &quot;reducer&quot;) and produces a
  reducing function that behaves as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>()</code>: calls <em>reducer</em> with no arguments
    (producing its identity)</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far</em><code>)</code>: Maybe
    transform the <em>result-so-far</em> and call <em>reducer</em>
  with it.</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far input</em><code>)</code> Maybe
    do something to <em>input</em> and maybe call the reducer with
    <em>result-so-far</em> and the maybe-transformed
    <em>input</em>.</li></ul>

<p>A simple example is as following: <code>(transduce (tfilter odd?) + '(1 2
  3 4 5))</code>.  This first returns a transducer filtering all odd
  elements, then it runs <code>+</code> without arguments to retrieve
  its identity.  It then starts the transduction by passing + to the
  transducer returned by <code>(tfilter odd?)</code> which returns a
  reducing function.  It works not unlike reduce from SRFI 1, but also
  checks whether one of the intermediate transducers returns a
  &quot;reduced&quot; value (implemented as a SRFI 9 record), which
  means the reduction finished early.</p>

<p>Because transducers compose and the final reduction is only
  executed in the last step, composed transducers will not build any
  intermediate result or collections.  Although the normal way of
  thinking about application of composed functions is right to left,
  due to how the transduction is built it is applied left to
  right.  <code>(compose (tfilter odd?) (tmap sqrt))</code> will
  create a transducer that first filter out any odd values and
  computes the square root of the rest.</p>

<h2 id="naming-1">Naming</h2>

<p>Transducers and procedures that return transducers all have names
  starting with t.  Reducing functions that are supposed to be used at
  the end of a transduction all start with r.  Some reducers are just
  straight up reducers, whereas others (like <code>rany</code> and
  <code>revery</code>) are procedures that returns reducers.</p>

<h2 id="scope-considerations">Scope considerations</h2>

<p>The procedures specified here are only for the collections defined
  in r7rs-small.  They could easily be extended to support r7rs-large
  red docket, but specifying that would require conforming
  implementations to also support a substantial part of the red
  docket.  I therefore leave transduce unspecified for many data
  types.  It is however encouraged to add [datatype]- transduce for
  whatever types your scheme supports.  Adding support for the
  collections of the red docket (sets, hash-tables, ilists, rlists,
  ideque, texts, lseqs, streams, generators and list-queues) is
  trivial.</p>

<p>The transduce form is always eager, and any general lazy
  application of transducers is outside the scope of this SRFI.</p>

<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>

<h2 id="applying-transducers">Applying transducers</h2>

<h3 id="transduce">transduce</h3>

<p><code>(list-transduce</code> <em>xform f lst</em><code>)</code>
  <br />
  <code>(list-transduce</code> <em>xform f identity lst</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Initializes the transducer xform by passing the reducer f to it.  If
  no identity is provided, f is run without arguments to return the
  reducer identity.  It then reduces over lst using the identity as the
  seed.</p>

<p>If one of the transducers finishes early (such as ttake or tdrop),
  it communicates this by returning a reduced value, which in the
  sample implementation is just a value wrapped in a SRFI 9 record
  type named &quot;reduced&quot;.  If such a value is returned by the
  transducer, list-transduce must stop execution immediately.</p>

<h3 id="vector-transduce">vector-transduce</h3>

<p><code>(vector-transduce</code> <em>xform f vec</em><code>)</code>
  <br />
  <code>(vector-transduce</code> <em>xform f identity vec</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Same as <code>transduce</code>, but reduces over a vector instead of a list.</p>

<h3 id="string-transduce">string-transduce</h3>

<p><code>(string-transduce</code> <em>xform f str</em><code>)</code>
  <br />
  <code>(string-transduce</code> <em>xform f identity str</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Same as <code>transduce</code>, but for strings.</p>

<h3 id="bytevector-transduce">bytevector-transduce</h3>

<p><code>(bytevector-transduce</code> <em>xform f bvec</em><code>)</code>
  <br />
  <code>(bytevector-transduce</code> <em>xform f identity bvec</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Same as transduce, but for bytevectors.</p>

<h2 id="reducers">Reducers</h2>

<h3 id="rcons"><code>rcons</code></h3>

<p>a simple consing reducer.  When called without values, it returns
  its identity: '(), with one value (which will be a list) it
  reverses the list.  When called with two values it conses the second
  value to the first.</p>

<p>May use non-linear reverse! at the end.</p>

<p>(transduce (tmap add1) rcons (list 0 1 2 3)) =&gt; (1 2 3 4)</p>

<h3 id="reverse-rcons"><code>reverse-rcons</code></h3>

<p>same as rcons, but leaves the values in their reversed order.</p>

<p>(transduce (tmap add1) reverse-rcons (list 0 1 2 3)) =&gt; (4 3 2
  1)</p>

<h3 id="rany-pred"><code>(rany</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>The reducer version of any.  Returns <code>(reduced (pred? value))</code> if any
  <code>(pred? value)</code> returns truthy.  The identity is <code>#f</code>.</p>

<p><code>(transduce (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) (rany odd?) (list 1 3 5))</code>
  =&gt; <code>#f</code>
  <code>(transduce (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) (rany odd?) (list 1 3
  4 5))</code> =&gt; <code>#t</code></p>

<h3 id="revery-pred"><code>(revery</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>The reducer version of every.  Stops the transduction and returns
  (reduced #f) if any (pred? value) returns #f.  If every (pred? value)
  returns true, it returns the result of the last invocation of (pred?
  value).</p>

<p><pre>(transduce
  (tmap add1)
  (revery (lambda (v) (if (odd? v) v #f)))
  (list 2 4 6))</pre> =&gt; <code>7</code>
  <br />
  <br />
  <code>(transduce (tmap add1) (revery odd?) (list 2 4 5 6))</code> =&gt; <code>#f</code></p>

<h3 id="rcount"><code>rcount</code></h3>

<p>A simple counting reducer.  Counts the values that pass through the
  transduction.</p>

<p><code>(transduce (tfilter odd?) rcount (list 1 2 3 4))</code> =&gt; <code>2.</code></p>

<h2 id="transducers">Transducers</h2>

<h3 id="tmap-proc"><code>(tmap</code> <em>proc</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that applies proc to all values.  Must be
  stateless.</p>

<h3 id="tfilter-pred"><code>(tfilter</code> <em>pred</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducers that removes values for which pred returns
  <code>#f</code>.  Must be stateless.</p>

<h3 id="tremove-pred"><code>(tremove</code> <em>pred</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that removes values for which pred returns
  truthy.  Must be stateless.</p>

<h3 id="tfilter-map-proc"><code>(tfilter-map</code> <em>proc</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>The same as <code>(compose (tmap proc) (tfilter values))</code>.
  Must be stateless.</p>

<h3 id="treplace-map"><code>(treplace</code> <em>map</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer which uses any value as a key in
  <em>map</em>.  If a mapping is found, the value of that mapping is
  returned, otherwise it just returns the original value.</p>

<p>Must not keep any internal state.  Modifying the map after treplace
  has been instantiated is an error.</p>

<h3 id="tdrop-n"><code>(tdrop</code> <em>n</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that discards the first <em>n</em> values.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>

<h3 id="ttake-n"><code>(ttake</code> <em>n</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that discards all values and stops the
  transduction after the first <em>n</em> values have been let through.  Any
  subsequent values are ignored.</p>

<p>Stateful</p>

<h3 id="tdrop-while-pred"><code>(tdrop-while</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that discards the the first values for which
  <em>pred?</em> returns true.</p>

<p>Stateful</p>

<h3 id="ttake-while-pred"><code>(ttake-while</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that stops the transduction after <em>pred?</em>
  has returned <code>#f</code>.  Any subsequent values are ignored and
  the last successful value is returned.</p>

<p>Stateful</p>

<h3 id="thalt-when-pred-retf"><code>(thalt-when</code> <em>pred? [retf]</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that stops the transduction if <code>pred?</code>
  returns true for a value.  <em>retf</em> must be a function of 2
  arguments that is passed the completed result so far and the value
  for which <em>pred?</em>  returned true.  If <em>retf</em> is not
  supplied it is the same thing as <code>(halt-when pred? (lambda
  (result-so-far value) value))</code>.  When called after it has
  stopped the transduction, it will always return the same value.</p>

<p>Is only useful together with <code>transduce</code> and will
  probably lead to errors in other contexts.</p>

<p>Stateful</p>

<h3 id="tcat"><code>tcat</code></h3>

<p>Tcat <strong>is</strong> a transducer that concatenates the content
  of each value (that must be a list) into the reduction.</p>

<p><code>(transduce tcat rcons '((1 2) (3 4 5) (6 (7 8) 9)))</code>
  =&gt;
  <code>(1 2 3 4 5 6 (7 8) 9)</code></p>

<h3 id="append-map-proc"><code>(append-map</code> <em>proc</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>The same as <code>(compose (tmap proc) tcat)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="tdedupe"><code>(tdedupe)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that removes consecutive duplicate
  elements.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>

<h3 id="tremove-duplicates"><code>(tremove-duplicates)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that removes any duplicate elements.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>

<h3 id="tflatten"><code>(tflatten)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that flattens an input consisting of lists.</p>

<p><code>(transduce (tflatten) rcons '((1 2) 3 (4 (5 6) 7 8) 9)</code> =&gt;
  <code>(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)</code></p>

<h3 id="tpartition-all-n"><code>(tpartition-all</code> <em>n</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that groups n inputs in lists of n
  elements.  When the transduction stops it flushes any remaining
  collection, even if it contains less than n elements.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>

<h3 id="tpartition-by-pred"><code>(tpartition-by</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that groups inputs in lists by whenever
  <code>(</code><em>pred? input</em><code>)</code> changes value.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>

<h3 id="tindex-start"><code>(tindex</code> <em>[start]</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that indexes values passed through it,
  starting at <em>start</em> which defaults to 0.  The indexing is done
  through cons pairs like <code>(</code><em>index</em> <code>.</code>
  <em>input</em><code>)</code>.</p>

<p>Stateful</p>

<h3 id="tlog-logger"><code>(tlog</code> <em>[logger]</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Returns a transducer that can be used to log or print values and
  results.  The result of the logger procedure is discarded.  The
  default logger is <code>(lambda (input result) (write input) (newline))</code>.</p>

<h1 id="sample-implementation">Sample implementation</h1>

<p>The sample implementation is written in Guile, but should be
  straightforward to port since it uses no guile-specific features
  apart from guile's hash-table implementation.  In fact, I am quite
  certain that It is written for clarity instead of speed, but should
  be plenty fast anyway.  The low hanging fruit for optimization is to
  replace the composed transducers (such as <code>tappend-map</code>
  and <code>tfilter-map</code>) with actual implementations.</p>

<h1 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>First of all, this would not have been done without Rich Hickey who
  introduced transducers into Clojure.  His talks were important for me
  to grasp the basics of transducers.  Then I would like to thank large
  parts of the Clojure community for also struggling with
  understanding transducers.  The amount of material produced
  explaining them in general, and Clojure's implementation
  specifically, has been instrumental in letting me make this a
  clean-room implementation.</p>

<p>Lastly I would like to thank Arthur Gleckler who showed interest in
  my implementation of transducers and convinced me to make this SRFI.</p>
