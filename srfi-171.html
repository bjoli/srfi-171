<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>A library implementing transducers &mdash; composable algorithmic
  transformations.  Scheme has many different ways of expressing
  transformations over different collection types, but they are all
  unique to whatever base type they work on.  This SRFI proposes a new
  construct, the transducer, that is oblivious to the context in which
  it is being used.</p>

<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>

<p>Some of the most common operations used in the scheme language are
  those transforming list: map, filter, take and so on.  They work
  well, are well understood and are used daily by most scheme
  programmers.  They are however not general because they only work on
  lists, and they do not compose very well since combining <code>N</code>
  of them builds <code>(- N 1)</code> intermediate lists.</p>

<p>Transducers are oblivious to what kind of process they are used in,
  and are composable without building intermediate collections.  This
  means we can create a transducer that squares all even numbers:
  <code>(compose (tfilter odd?) (tmap (lambda (x) (* x x))))</code>
  and reuse it with lists, vectors or in just about any context where
  data flows in one direction.  We could use it as a processing step
  for asynchronous channels, with an event framework as a
  pre-processing step or even in lazy contexts where you pass lazy
  collection and a transducer to a function and get a new lazy
  collection back.</p>

<p>The traditional scheme approach of having collection-specific
  procedures is not changed.  We instead specify a general form of
  transformations that complement these procedures.  The benefits are
  obvious: We get a clear, well understood way of describing common
  transformations in a way that is faster than just chaining the
  collection-specific counterparts.  Even for slower schemes where the
  overhead of transducers is big, the effects on garbage collection
  times are often dramatic, making transducers very attractive.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>The sample implementation of transducers depends on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SRFI 9, <code>define-record-type</code> (included in r7rs-small)</li>
  <li>SRFI-69 (hash-tables)</li>
  <li>Proper compose procedure (included if it is not available)</li>
  <li>A <code>vector-&gt;list</code> that behaves like in SRFI 43
      (included in r7rs-small).</li></ul>

<h2 id="portability">Portability</h2>

<p>The sample implementation is easily portable to any
r5rs/r6rs/r7rs-compatible scheme.  The non-standard things are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <code>vector-&gt;list</code> that takes a start and end
      argument</li>
  <li>A hash-table implementation with support for arbitrary equality
      predicates</li>
  <li><code>case-lambda</code>, preferably efficiently
    implemented</li></ul>

<h1 id="general-discussion">General discussion</h1>

<h2 id="concept-reducers">Concept: Reducers</h2>

<p>The central part of transducers are 3-arity reducing functions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>()</code>: Produce an identity</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far</em><code>)</code>: completion.
      If you have nothing to do, then just return the result so far</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far input</em><code>)</code> do
      whatever you like to the input and produce a new
      <em>result-so-far</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of a summing <code>+</code> reducer, the reducer would
  produce, in arity order: <code>0</code>, <em>result-so-far</em>,
  (<code>+</code> <em>result-so-far input</em>).  This happens to be
    exactly what the regular <code>+</code> does.</p>

<h2 id="concept-transducers">Concept: Transducers</h2>

<p>A transducer is a one-arity function that takes a reducing function
  (in the list below called simply &quot;reducer&quot;) and produces a
  reducing function that behaves as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>()</code>: calls <em>reducer</em> with no arguments
    (producing its identity)</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far</em><code>)</code>: Maybe
    transform the <em>result-so-far</em> and call <em>reducer</em>
  with it.</li>
  <li><code>(</code><em>result-so-far input</em><code>)</code> Maybe
    do something to <em>input</em> and maybe call the reducer with
    <em>result-so-far</em> and the maybe-transformed
    <em>input</em>.</li></ul>

<p>A simple example is as following: <code>(list-transduce (tfilter odd?) + '(1 2
  3 4 5))</code>.  This first returns a transducer filtering all odd
  elements, then it runs <code>+</code> without arguments to retrieve
  its identity.  It then starts the transduction by passing + to the
  transducer returned by <code>(tfilter odd?)</code> which returns a
  reducing function.  It works not unlike reduce from SRFI 1, but also
  checks whether one of the intermediate transducers returns a
  &quot;reduced&quot; value (implemented as a SRFI 9 record), which
  means the reduction finished early.</p>

<p>Because transducers compose and the final reduction is only
  executed in the last step, composed transducers will not build any
  intermediate result or collections.  Although the normal way of
  thinking about application of composed functions is right to left,
  due to how the transduction is built it is applied left to
  right.  <code>(compose (tfilter odd?) (tmap sqrt))</code> will
  create a transducer that first filter out any odd values and
    computes the square root of the rest.</p>

<h2 id="state">State</h2>
<p> Even though transducers are somewhat of a generalisation of map and
    friends, this is not really true.  Since transducers don't know in
    which context they are being used, some transducers must keep state
    where their collection-specific counterparts do not.  This SRFI
    requires some transducers to be stateless (as is stated in the
    documentation of each transducer), but many are allowed to keep
    state. How state is kept in not specified. The reference
    implementation uses mutable values in closures which is efficient
    and portable, but has all the problems of hidden mutable state.</p>

<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>

<p>Transducers and procedures that return transducers all have names
  starting with t.  Reducing functions that are supposed to be used at
  the end of a transduction all start with r.  Some reducers are just
  straight up reducers, whereas others (like <code>rany</code> and
  <code>revery</code>) are procedures that returns reducers.</p>

<h2 id="scope-considerations">Scope considerations</h2>

<p>The procedures specified here are only for the collections defined
  in r7rs-small.  They could easily be extended to support r7rs-large
  red docket, but specifying that would require conforming
  implementations to also support a substantial part of the red
  docket.  I therefore leave transduce unspecified for many data
  types.  It is however encouraged to add [datatype]-transduce for
  whatever types your scheme supports.  Adding support for the
  collections of the r7rs red docket (sets, hash-tables, ilists, rlists,
  ideque, texts, lseqs, streams, generators and list-queues) is
  trivial.</p>


<h2 id="lazy-eager">Eager or lazy semantics</h2>

<p> There is some overlap in the use case of transducers and lazy constructs
    like generators or streams. One big benefit is that you can compose
    transformations without building unnecessary intermediate state. There
    are however differences. Laziness is usually described as having "pull"
    semantics, i.e: you pull values through a pipeline of lazy contructs,
    transforming and filtering them on the way. This way you get only what
    you need.
</p>


<p> Transducers, being oblivious to context, are neither eager nor lazy but are
    generally meant for eager contexts. The transduce form is always eager, and
    any general lazy application of transducers is outside the scope of this SRFI.

<h2 id="applying-transducers">Applying transducers</h2>

<h3 id="list-transduce">list-transduce</h3>

<p><code>(list-transduce</code> <em>xform f lst</em><code>)</code>
  <br />
  <code>(list-transduce</code> <em>xform f identity lst</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Initializes the transducer xform by passing the reducer f to it.  If
  no identity is provided, f is run without arguments to return the
  reducer identity.  It then reduces over lst using the identity as the
  seed.</p>

<p>If one of the transducers finishes early (such as <code>ttake</code> or <code>tdrop</code>),
  it communicates this by returning a reduced value, which in the
  sample implementation is just a value wrapped in a SRFI 9 record
  type named &quot;reduced&quot;.  If such a value is returned by the
  transducer, list-transduce must stop execution immediately.</p>


<h3 id="vector-transduce">vector-transduce</h3>

<p><code>(vector-transduce</code> <em>xform f vec</em><code>)</code>
  <br />
  <code>(vector-transduce</code> <em>xform f identity vec</em><code>)</code></p>

<p>Same as <code>transduce</code>, but reduces over a vector instead of a list.</p>


<h3 id="string-transduce">string-transduce</h3>
<p><code>(string-transduce</code> <em>xform f str</em><code>)</code>
  <br />
  <code>(string-transduce</code> <em>xform f identity str</em><code>)</code></p>

  <br />
  <code>(port-transduce</code> <em>xform f init reader port</em><code>)</code></p>

<p> Applies <code>(xform f)</code> to every value produces by <code>(reader port)</code> until
  <code>#eof-object</code> is returned.</p>

  =&gt; (2 4)</p>

<h3 id="rcons"><code>rcons</code></h3>

<p>a simple consing reducer.  When called without values, it returns
  its identity: '(), with one value (which will be a list) it
  reverses the list.  When called with two values it conses the second
  value to the first.</p>

<p><code>(list-transduce (tmap add1) rcons (list 0 1 2 3))</code> =&gt; (1 2 3 4)</p>

<h3 id="reverse-rcons"><code>reverse-rcons</code></h3>

<p>same as rcons, but leaves the values in their reversed order.</p>

<p><code>(list-transduce (tmap add1) reverse-rcons (list 0 1 2 3))</code> =&gt; (4 3 2
  1)</p>

<h3 id="rany-pred"><code>(rany</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>

    =&gt; <code>#f</code>
    <br />
    <br />

  <code>(list-transduce (tmap (lambda (x) (+ x 1))) (rany odd?) (list 1 3
  4 5))</code> =&gt; <code>#t</code></p>

<h3 id="revery-pred"><code>(revery</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>The reducer version of every.  Stops the transduction and returns
  (reduced #f) if any (pred? value) returns #f.  If every (pred? value)
  returns true, it returns the result of the last invocation of (pred?
  value).</p>

<p><pre>(list-transduce
  (tmap add1)
  (revery (lambda (v) (if (odd? v) v #f)))
  (list 2 4 6))</pre> =&gt; <code>7</code>

  Must be stateless.</p>


<h3 id="treplace-map"><code>(treplace</code> <em>map</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer which uses any value as a key in
  <em>map</em>.  If a mapping is found, the value of that mapping is
  returned, otherwise it just returns the original value.</p>

<p>Must not keep any internal state.  Modifying the map after treplace
  has been instantiated is an error.</p>


<h3 id="tdrop-n"><code>(tdrop</code> <em>n</em><code>)</code></h3>

<h3 id="ttake-n"><code>(ttake</code> <em>n</em><code>)</code></h3>

  the last successful value is returned. <code>retf</code> is a function that gets called whenever
  <em>pred?</em> returns false. The arguments passed are the result so far and the input for which
  <em>pred?</em> returns <code>#f</code>. The default function is
  <code>(lambda (result input) result)</code></p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tconcatenate"><code>tconcatenate</code></h3>
<p>tconcatenate <strong>is</strong> a transducer that concatenates the content
  of each value (that must be a list) into the reduction.</p>

<p><code>(list-transduce tconcatenate rcons '((1 2) (3 4 5) (6 (7 8) 9)))</code>
  =&gt;
    <code>(1 2 3 4 5 6 (7 8) 9)</code></p>

  elements. The default <em>equality-predicate</em> is <code>equal?</code>.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tremove-duplicates"><code>(tdelete-duplicates <em>[equality-predicate]</em>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that removes any subsequent duplicate elements compared using
  <em>equality-predicate</em>. If the underlying data structure used for detecting duplicates
  can't handle arbitrar equality predicates, it should at least support
  <code>eq?</code>, <code>eqv?</code> and <code>equal?</code>. The default <em>equality-predicate</em>
  is <code>equal?</code>.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tsegment"><code>(tsegment</code> <em>n</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that groups n inputs in lists of n
  elements.  When the transduction stops it flushes any remaining
  collection, even if it contains less than n elements.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tpartition-pred"><code>(tpartition</code> <em>pred?</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that groups inputs in lists by whenever

<p>Stateful.</p>

<h3 id="tinterpose-value"><code>(tinterpose </code> <em>value</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p>Stateful.</p>



<h3 id="tenumerate-start"><code>(tenumerate</code> <em>[start]</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that indexes values passed through it,
  starting at <em>start</em> which defaults to 0.  The indexing is done
  through cons pairs like <code>(</code><em>index</em> <code>.</code>
  <em>input</em><code>)</code>.</p>

<p>Stateful.</p>


<h3 id="tlog-logger"><code>(tlog</code> <em>[logger]</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a transducer that can be used to log or print values and
  results.  The result of the logger procedure is discarded.  The
    default logger is <code>(lambda (result input) (write input) (newline))</code>.</p>


<h2 id="helpers">Helper functions for writing transducers</h2>

<p>These functions are in the <code>(srfi 171 meta)</code> module and are only usable
    when you want to write your own transducers. </p>


<h3 id="reduced"><code>(reduced</code> <em>value</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> Wraps a value in a <code>&lt;reduced&gt;</code> container, signalling that the
    reduction should stop.</p>


<h3 id="reducedp"><code(reduced?</code> <em>value</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>value</em> is <code>reduced</code></p>


<h3 id="unreduce"><code>(unreduce</code> <em>reduced-container</em><code>)</code></h3>

<p> Wraps <em>value</em> in a reduced container if it is not already reduced.</p>


<h3 id="preserving-reduced"><code>(preserving-reduced</code> <em>reducer</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> Wraps <em>reducer</em> in another reducer that encapsulates any returned reduced value in
    another reduced container. This is useful in places where you re-use a reducer with
    [collection]-reduce. If the reducer returns a reduced value, [collection]-reduce unwraps
    it. Unless handled, this leads to the reduction continuing.
</p>


<h3 id="list-reduce"><code>(list-reduce</code> <em>f identity lst</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The reducing function used internally by <code>list-transduce</code>. <em>f</em> is reducer
    as returned by a transducer. <em>identity</em> is the identity (sometimes called "seed") of
    the reduction. <em>lst</em> is a list.</p>


<h3 id="vector-reduce"><code>(vector-reduce</code> <em> f identity vec</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The vector version of <code>list-reduce</code></p>


<h3 id="string-reduce"><code>(string-reduce</code> <em> f identity str</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The string version of <code>list-reduce</code></p>


<h3 id="bytevector-u8-reduce"><code>(bytevector-u8-reduce</code> <em> f identity bv</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The bytevector-u8 version of <code>list-reduce</code></p>


<h3 id="string-reduce"><code>(string-reduce</code> <em> f identity str</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The string version of <code>list-reduce</code></p>


<h3 id="string-reduce"><code>(port-reduce</code> <em> f identity reader port</em><code>)</code></h3>
<p> The port version of <code>list-reducer</code>.  It reduces over <em>port</em> using
    <em>reader</em> until <em>reader</em> returns <code>#eof-object</code>.</p>



<h1 id="sample-implementation">Sample implementation</h1>

<p> The sample implementation is written in Guile, but should be
   straightforward to port since it uses no guile-specific features
   apart from guile's hash-table implementation.  In fact, I am quite
   certain that It is written for clarity instead of speed, but should
   be plenty fast anyway.  The low hanging fruit for optimization is to
   replace the composed transducers (such as <code>tappend-map</code>
    and <code>tfilter-map</code>) with non-composed implementations.</p>

<p> Another optimization would be to return whether or not a reducer
    can return a reduced value, thus allowing [collection]-reduce to
    avoid checking for reduced values.</p>


<h1 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>First of all, this would not have been done without Rich Hickey who
  introduced transducers into Clojure.  His talks were important for me
  to grasp the basics of transducers.  Then I would like to thank large
  parts of the Clojure community for also struggling with
  understanding transducers.  The amount of material produced
  explaining them in general, and Clojure's implementation
  specifically, has been instrumental in letting me make this a
    clean-room implementation.</p>

<p>I'd also like to thank Juanpe Bolivar who implemented pure transducers
    for c++ (in the Atria library) and did a wonderful presentation about them.</p>

<p>Lastly I would like to thank Arthur Gleckler who showed interest in
  my implementation of transducers and convinced me to make this SRFI.</p>
